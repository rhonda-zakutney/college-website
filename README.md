# college-website

During our group project I was in charge of the applications aspect of the website which included:
-creating various user roles such as applicants, recommenders, faculty reviewers, CAC; and organizing the data using SQL to separate the various user infos.
- Create form validation for applications, create account function, and implement other security measures such as bypas prevention.
- Create review forms for each faculty reviewer.
